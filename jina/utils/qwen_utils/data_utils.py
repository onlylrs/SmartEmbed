"""Utility helpers previously bundled with a legacy multimodal dataset implementation.

Only the `load_image` helper is retained because it is still used by
`jina/data/preprocess.py` to validate image paths when converting raw
datasets.  The full Dataset / collate_fn definitions were removed to
avoid confusionâ€”our project now uses `src.datasets.multimodal_dataset` as
the single source of truth for data loading.
